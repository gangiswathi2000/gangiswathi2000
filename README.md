## 📘 My Chapter

🎓 I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at <strong>Oregon State University</strong> (Go Beavs! 🧡), with a strong interest in  
Software Engineering, Web Development, and a growing curiosity towards AI.

🔧 My work spans both full-stack development and backend engineering from designing intuitive web applications to solving complex problems through robust system design.

🌊 At present, I’m developing a web platform for OSU Glider group that enables oceanographers to visualize real-time data through interactive tools.

💼 At <strong>Planon</strong>, I built scalable software solutions in Java, developed RESTful APIs, and streamlined cloud-based workflows.

✍️ Outside of development, I’ve authored and edited 30 technical articles on <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/gangiswathi2000/contributions/" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks</a> covering Data Structures and web technologies.

💡 I enjoy turning ideas into intuitive, impactful tools and solving the tough problems along the way.
